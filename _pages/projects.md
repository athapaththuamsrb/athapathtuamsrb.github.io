  **Supervised by:**  
   [Dr. Subha Fernando](https://uom.lk/staff/Fernando.KSD)

  - For this work we use LLAMA model and codeGen model.
  - Here we mainly fine tune this model to dialog summarizing and Q&A (Speciality is this model direct to our business flow)
  - Contributed as a developer in prompt engineering ,training and RL
